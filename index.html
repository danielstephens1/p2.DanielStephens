    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
            Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Pros vs. Cons:</font>
    </div>

    <dl>
      <dt>1.  Pros</dt>
      <dd>The design of the control panel includes “Express Cook” which allows for single button presses
        1-6 that will cook food for the given selection. The problem with this is it doesn’t allow for specific time cooking.
         If you wanted to cook for 45 seconds, it would be impossible to set the timer for that duration. </dd>
         <br>
      <dt>2.Cons</dt>
      <dd>The top 6 buttons allow a user to cook specific foods by sensing, however the buttons give little-to-no specification.
         The user doesn’t know how large the food can be for the microwave to cook successfully. </dd>
         <br>
      <dt>3. Flat Interface</dt>
      <dd>For a person with a seeing disability, this microwave would be difficult to operate. All the buttons are flush with the panel
        and have no textile indicator as to which buttons are which. This makes it very difficult to be accurate with your selection.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
            Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Common Uses:</font>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>Reheating leftovers</li>
      <li>Cooking premade meals</li>
      <li>Warming beverages</li>
    </ul>

    <dd>The “Express Cook” feature is most useful when reheating leftover food. By pressing a single button, I can reheat cold food to a very
       hot temperature without any thought. The “Start” button also acts as an “add 30 seconds” button to quickly add 30 seconds to the timer.</dd>

    <br><br>
    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
               Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Rare Uses:</font>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>Softening butter</li>
      <li>Cooking vegetables</li>
      <li>Popping popcorn</li>
    </ul>

    <dd>The “Express Cook” feature is also very limiting, as certain things require more precision than others. When softening butter, I usually need
       only 10 seconds, but entering 10 seconds is impossible due to the “Express Cook” feature. Instead of 1 second when pressing the “1” button, it will
        select “1 minute”, making smaller timers impossible.</dd>

    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
                   Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Sequence of Actions:</font>
    </div>
    <br>
    <dd>The most common sequence of actions is pressing an “Express Cook” button, followed by the “Start” button to add 30 seconds.</dd>

    <br><br>
    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
                   Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Support and Feedback:</font>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>Support</li>
      <dd>The microwave uses large clear buttons on the control panel to indicate to the user how it works.
         The text is written with a large contrast to make reading each button easy and quick</dd><br>
      <li>Feedback</li>
      <dd>Feedback is given through the small screen lit by LEDs on the top. This tells the user how many minutes and seconds are left until the food is finished cooking.
         The microwave also beeps when the timer is completed, so it doesn’t require the user to stay in front of the microwave throughout the cooking process.</dd><br>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
                   Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Mistakes:</font>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>A very common mistake made with this microwave is trying to enter a specific cook time into the microwave. The user might assume they can enter 45 seconds,
         but the microwave’s “Express Cook” feature will see the input “4” as “4 minutes” and immediately begin cooking for 4 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Another mistake is pressing the “Start” button after pressing an “Express Cook” button. Once an “Express Cook” button has been pressed, the microwave will
         immediately begin cooking, but the user might think they need to press “Start”, which will just add 30 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

                   Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Simplified Microwave Interface Sketch:</font>
    </div><br>

    <div>

      <p align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
                    Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "4">Changes to Control Panel:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of Buttons</li>
        <li>Button Combinations</li>
        <li>Clock Indicator</li>
        <li>Braille</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This interface has been simplified to benefit the user. There are fewer buttons which never get used, so the numbers and "Start/Stop" buttons
          can be larger. The "Add 30 seconds" option has been given it's own button to lower chances of confusion. The clock now features an "AM/PM" light
          so the user can differenciate between the timer and the clock. Each numbered button has braille so a person with a seeing disability can find the correct
          buttons to press. </p>

<div>
  <p>This is an example of the Touch Screen Microwave Interface</p><br>
  <img src="Assets/TouchMicrowave.jpg" alt="Pic of Touch Microwave Interface" width="1000" height="500" /><br>
  <p>The panel displays a clock, weather report, calendar, and cooking interface. The "Speech" button allows for speech to be turned off or on.
      The main section allows for precise inputs but also has a quick add feature to allow faster addition of time.</p>
