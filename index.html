    <dd>The “Express Cook” feature is most useful when reheating leftover food. By pressing a single button, I can reheat cold food to a very
       hot temperature without any thought. The “Start” button also acts as an “add 30 seconds” button to quickly add 30 seconds to the timer.</dd>

    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:

      <li> </li>
      <li> </li>
    </ul>

    <dd>The “Express Cook” feature is also very limiting, as certain things require more precision than others. When softening butter, I usually need
       only 10 seconds, but entering 10 seconds is impossible due to the “Express Cook” feature. Instead of 1 second when pressing the “1” button, it will
        select “1 minute”, making smaller timers impossible.</dd>

    <div align = "left"><font style = "font-family:
                   Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" color = "#000000" size = "5">Mistakes:</font>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>A very common mistake made with this microwave is trying to enter a specific cook time into the microwave. The user might assume they can enter 45 seconds,
         but the microwave’s “Express Cook” feature will see the input “4” as “4 minutes” and immediately begin cooking for 4 minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Another mistake is pressing the “Start” button after pressing an “Express Cook” button. Once an “Express Cook” button has been pressed, the microwave will
         immediately begin cooking, but the user might think they need to press “Start”, which will just add 30 seconds.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>This interface has been simplified to benefit the user. There are fewer buttons which never get used, so the numbers and "Start/Stop" buttons
          can be larger. The "Add 30 seconds" option has been given it's own button to lower chances of confusion. The clock now features an "AM/PM" light
          so the user can differenciate between the timer and the clock. Each numbered button has braille so a person with a seeing disability can find the correct
          buttons to press. </p>
